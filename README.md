# Banking System in C++
## Introduction:
Banking System is a C++ program that simulates a banking management system. This program allows users to create and manage different types of accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, view account balances and transaction history, transfer funds, and more. It is designed to demonstrate mastery of object-oriented programming concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, association, aggregation, and composition. This Program is only terminal based.

## Usage:
The Banking System allows for the following interactions:

### User Client:
Create a new User Client account with personal information.
1. Deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
2. View account balance and transaction history.
3. Transfer funds to other User Client accounts.
4. Access the account using a unique User ID and PIN.
### Company Client:
1. Create a Company Client account with company information.
2. Deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
3. View account balance and transaction history.
4. Transfer funds to User Client accounts within the same company.
5. Request loans from the bank.
6. Access the account using a unique User ID and PIN.
7. Access the account as an employee of the company, if authorized.
### Banking Employee:
1. Log in as a banking employee with a unique User ID and password.
2. View the list of all client's accounts.
3. Approve or reject new account applications.
4. Approve or reject loan requests of companies.
5. View transaction history for a specific account.
6. Freeze or close an account if necessary.
